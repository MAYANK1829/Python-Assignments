    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators? Describe a condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "\n",
    "== is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is the assignment operator that stores a value in a variable. For example, 3==5 (True) & spam=10.\n",
    "A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean value.\n",

    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "\n",
    "Break statement- to exit or “break” a for or while conditional loop. When the loop ends, the code picks up from and executes the next line immediately following the loop that was broken.\n",
    "The continue statement is used to skip code within a loop for certain iterations of the loop. After the code is skipped, the loop continues where it left off. \n",
    "Break statement will move the execution outside and just after a loop & Continue statement will move the execution to the start of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "\n",
    "No difference. The range(10) call ranges from 0 to 10 (excluding 10), range(0, 10) tells the loop to start at 0, and end at 10 (excluding 10) and range(0, 10, 1) tells the loop to start at 0, and end at 10 (excluding 10)  & to increase the variable by 1 on positive axis on each iteration.\n",

    "12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
