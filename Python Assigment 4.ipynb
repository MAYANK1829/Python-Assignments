    "1. What exactly is []?\n",

    "The empty list, which is a list that contains no items. Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[].\n",

    "\n",
    "List concatenation operator is +, and list replication operator is *.\n",

    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "\n",
    "append() will add values only to the end of a list, and insert() can add them anywhere in the list.\n",

    "Both lists and strings can be concatenated or replicated , passed to len(), have indexes and slices, and can be used in for loops.\n",

    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are mutable that is values can be added, removed, or changed while Tuples are immutable that is they cannot be changed. Lists use [] while tuples use ().\n",

    "References to list values.\n",

    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy of a list, while copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy of a list meaning only copy.deepcopy() will duplicate any list inside a list.\n"
