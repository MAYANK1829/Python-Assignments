    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "* = expression\n",
    "'hello' = value\n",
    "-87.8 = value\n",
    "- = expression\n",
    "/ = expression\n",
    "+ = expression\t\n",
    "6 = value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Variable is a store of information, and a string is a type of information we store in a Variable. String always start and end with quotes while variable does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Numeric data type- This represents the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be Integer represented by int class which contains positive or negative whole numbers (without fraction or decimal) , Float represented by float class which is a real number with floating point representation denoted by a decimal point & Complex Numbers represented by complex class which is specified as (real part) + (imaginary part)j such as 2+3j.\n",
    " \n",
    "2.Sequence- It is the ordered collection of similar or different data types which allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python - String= A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote or double-quote & is represented by str class, List= List is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type & Tuple= Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of data. The only difference between tuple and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created & are represented by tuple class. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Boolean- Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False & is denoted by the class bool.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Expression is made up of values(constants), variables, operators, and calls to functions. All expressions need to be evaluated (that is, reduced to a single value) so to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result which is always a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes spam = 10 is an assignment statement.\n",
    "An Expression always returns a value and can print result while a statement never returns a value and cannot print any result. In simpler terms, anything that evaluates to something is a Python expression, while on the other hand, anything that does something is a Python statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "bacon=22\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "'spamspamspam' (for both the terms)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a variable name cannot be started with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "int(), float() & str()\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Because str can only concatenate to str not int.\n",
    "Fix= 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'\n",
